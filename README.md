# genetic path planning

This repository contains Matlab code for using Genetic Search with A* search for robotic path planning.

Given an unordered list of stopping points, a cost function, and a floor plan, an optimal list of stops is calculated using genetic search.

This repository provides two endpoints: A GUI application, and a function.
